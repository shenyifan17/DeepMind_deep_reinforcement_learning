# yifanflow
Archived Google DeepMind deep learning and reinforcement learning course. 


yifanflow_framework.py contains numpy version of vanilla and convolutional neural networks 

This project is called yifanflow as it is a alternative to tensorflow! (Only vanilla neural networks and CNN though :) ) 

Perhaps will add numpy version of RNN in the future...
