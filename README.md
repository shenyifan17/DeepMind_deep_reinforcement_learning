numpy version of neural networks (vanilla and CNN). 

This is my numpy version of vanilla and convolutional neural networks. 

It is part of the UCL MSc CSML DeepMind course, the task was to build a "tensorflow" in numpy, then compare our numpy version with tensorflow 
(of course tensorflow runs a lot faster!)
